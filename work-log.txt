NOTES TO KEEP TRACK OF PROGRESS, IDEAS, PROBLEMS EG.
----------------------------------------------------

--- 1/23/17 ---
Matildha:
Created git repo. Copied fhresh pintos files into it and commited, 
none of my previous changes to lab1 added yet. 
  Made all the tests in lab0 and added commands to .bashrc. Unsure if it works 
properly though. Added the tags to emacs and ran the alarm-single with and without gdb.
  
TODO: Try to understand what changes I made to lab1 and then transfer them into new 
project if seems correct. !DONE!

--- 1/27/17 ---
Matildha:
Changed the *esp pointer to PYSBASE - 12 and set process_wait() to infinite loop. 
   Much of what I did previously in lab1 seem to be kinda of wrong... 

--- 1/31/17 ---
Matildha:
Copied old halt() function to present. 
   
TODO: Should all syscall functions be declared static? 

--- 2/1/17 ---
Matildha:
Create file function seems to work. Does not test arguments. 
   Found useful read and write operations in file.c. (good filename lol)

Added nr_open_files to 'struct thread' and pointer to dynamically allocated array for file descriptor table - which consists of 'struct file*' pointers. Failed to allocate array in thread_init() since #ifdef USERPROG made it unavaiable.
   Wrote something quick in syscall, a function callled init_fd_table that allocates the array and sets nr_open_files to 0. Not finished, not tested. 
TODO: Try to initialize fd_table and nr_open_files in syscall.c. 

--- 2/2/17 ---
Matildha:
You are allowed to put fd_table array i thread struct. Set all elements to NULL in thread_init. 
  Succeeded to open a file and put it at the first position in the fd_table. Added max_nr_open_files in thread struct. 
TODO: Should this be constant? HOW?
TODO: Fix get_new_fd() to handle several open calls.
