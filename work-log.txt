Matildha:
Created git repo. Copied fhresh pintos files into it and commited, 
none of my previous changes to lab1 added yet. 
  Made all the tests in lab0 and added commands to .bashrc. Unsure if it works 
properly though. Added the tags to emacs and ran the alarm-single with and without gdb.
  
TODO: Try to understand what changes I made to lab1 and then transfer them into new 
project if seems correct.

--- 1/27/17 ---
Matildha:
Changed the *esp pointer to PYSBASE - 12 and set process_wait() to infinite loop.
