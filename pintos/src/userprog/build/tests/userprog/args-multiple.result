FAIL
Test output failed to match any acceptable form.

Acceptable output:
  (args) begin
  (args) argc = 5
  (args) argv[0] = 'args-multiple'
  (args) argv[1] = 'some'
  (args) argv[2] = 'arguments'
  (args) argv[3] = 'for'
  (args) argv[4] = 'you!'
  (args) argv[5] = null
  (args) end
  args-multiple: exit(0)
Differences in `diff -u' format:
+ Before waiting in load_sema
+ End of setup_stack()
+ Before load sema up
+ Before last line in start_process()

+ After sema up in process_exit() Exiting with status 0
+ At end of process_exit()
+ Awoke from load_sema
+ Set new child id to 3
+ End of process execute
+ In process_wait()
+ Cmp children ids: 3 and given 3
+ Child found in wait
+ Child with exit status 0 has already exited
