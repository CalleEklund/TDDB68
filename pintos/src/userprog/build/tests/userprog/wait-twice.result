FAIL
Test output failed to match any acceptable form.

Acceptable output:
  (wait-twice) begin
  (child-simple) run
  child-simple: exit(81)
  (wait-twice) wait(exec()) = 81
  (wait-twice) wait(exec()) = -1
  (wait-twice) end
  wait-twice: exit(0)
Differences in `diff -u' format:
- (wait-twice) begin
- (child-simple) run
- child-simple: exit(81)
- (wait-twice) wait(exec()) = 81
- (wait-twice) wait(exec()) = -1
- (wait-twice) end
- wait-twice: exit(0)
