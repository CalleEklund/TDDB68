Differences in `diff -u' format:
+ Before waiting in load_sema
+ End of setup_stack()
+ Before load sema up
+ Before last line in start_process()
  (read-boundary) begin
  (read-boundary) open "sample.txt"
+ Awoke from load_sema
+ Set new child id to 3
+ End of process execute
+ In process_wait()
+ Cmp children ids: 3 and given 3
+ Child found in wait
+ Waiting for child to terminate...
  (read-boundary) end
+ Syscall exit
+ Start of process_exit()
  read-boundary: exit(0)
+ After sema up in process_exit() Exiting with status 0
+ At end of process_exit()
